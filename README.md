**Predictive Maintenance in Midstream Operations**

General Overview

The midstream sector is responsible for moving so much product that even slight deviations from optimal operational parameters could cost operators dearly - not to mention the potential losses, and in the worst-case scenario, total shutdown caused by equipment failure.

More than ever before, data is enabling engineers and subject matter experts to be proactive rather than reactive when addressing issues. For example, instead of scrambling to resolve a compressor failure after it has happened, subject matter experts can use advanced analytics applications to generate predictions that suggest when a failure is likely to occur, and take action to minimize impacts.

Bearing failure in a compressor, which occurs with little warning, making scheduled maintenance difficult. Unplanned bearing failures result in costly downtime, due to system interdependence.

Developing an analysis to predict these failures requires collaboration between multiple roles within an organization. During this process, subject matter experts can cleanse data, identify normal operation, calculate statistical thresholds, and identify deviations. Data scientists can use this cleansed data and operational context to further the analysis, building a bearing health status signal by running an anomaly detection algorithm. Operators and managers can monitor the results in real-time to stay informed of potential issues.

After developing and implementing this model, maintenance staff receive notifications when abnormal operating conditions are identified, several days prior to failure, enabling the team to preemptively address issues and reduce failures. For a critical refrigeration compressor, preventing a single bearing failure resulted in lost time savings of more than half a million dollars.

When predictive maintenance is embraced, transformation occurs. 

It requires:
- Using existing sensors and/or instrumenting assets with sensors;
- Capturing a constant stream of data on asset conditions;
- Analyzing that data in real time;
- Providing insights and real-time alerting;
- Optimized recommendations for planned maintenance.

Using predictive analytics, we can assist oil and gas pipeline operators to predict pipeline failures and thereby save lives, protect the environment, reduce operational costs and address regulatory compliance requirements.
